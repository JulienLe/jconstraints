 * Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
 * Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 * cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
 * within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 * granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
 * filed.
 *
 * <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
 * thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that
 * You meet the following conditions:

 * Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 * as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with
 * the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever
 * such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
 * purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
 * Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
 * Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
 * License.
 *
 * <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
 * different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
 * modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
 * distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 * <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
 * intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms
 * and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the

 * may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 * <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

 * use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 * <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
 * provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
 * WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 * any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 * PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
 * redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
 * this License.
 *
 * <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
 * negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
 * grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
 * damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 * character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
 * (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
 * malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
 * been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 * <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
 * Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
 * indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
 * accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
 * not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
 * Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
 * by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 * <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 * <p>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 * <p>To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the
